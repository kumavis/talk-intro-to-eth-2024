intro to cryptography
  hash
  symetric key
  asymetric key

intro to blockchain
  lets build a public permissionless system
  public "state", identity
  whats missing? doublespend / tx ordering
  timestamps are not a cryptographic primitive
  we can elect a leader to order txs, and others can verify validity
  leader election, PoW and PoS
    PoW: partcipants compete for the golden ticket
    PoS: participants are known and ordered, take turns
      "virtual mining" analogy
  its a job, so we can pay
  tx throughput, tx fees
  monetary policy
